                            <p>In addition to the purposes stipulated in this Privacy Statement, and only to the extent this is explicitly allowed by law or such an obligation is imposed on Jacobs by law, we may use your Personal Data for further purposes under the conditions laid down in local relevant legislation. In any case, Jacobs shall observe transparency and the rest of the principles for lawful processing of your Personal Data.</p>
                            <h5 class="pt-3">Website Usage Data</h5>

                            <p>Where relevant, in particular if you are a supplier or customer of Jacobs, we may also use this information to perform our obligations and pursue our rights under the contract entered into by you and us, including in the context of any legal proceedings if necessary. Such information is also collected and treated at the stage prior to concluding any contract as a follow-up to you placing an order or making any other relevant inquiry. Failure to provide us with such information may prevent us from smoothly performing our obligations in the context of an existing or future contractual relation.</p>
                            <p>Where relevant, in particular if you are a user of Jacobs products or services, we may also use this information to comply with our relevant legal obligations, such as under the legislation regulating product liability.</p>
                            <h3 class="pt-3">Sharing your Personal Data?</h3>
                            <p>Without prejudice to any disclosure of information made compulsory by competent authorities and only to the extent such disclosure is required by law, Personal Data you provide to Jacobs may be shared, consistent with applicable law and in accordance with the purposes each time served, as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    With Jacobs departments, including representatives and employees, as necessary.

                            </ul>
                            <p>All service providers to Jacobs will use Personal Data only for the purposes identified in this notice and will provide services under a contract which restricts use of information to that which is necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.</p>
                            <p>Because Jacobs operates globally with locations in many different countries, we may transfer your information from one legal entity to another or from one country to another in order to accomplish purposes listed in this notice.
